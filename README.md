# E-learning_completion rates

The code is combining the logs from the Learning Platform and staff counts
to produce completion rate metrics. 

## Completion rates calculations

The completion rate is calculated as the quotient of:

- total employees that completed the training up to end of the reporting month
- total employees in a given month.

Note that the completion rate is thus a 'snapshot'.


## To run the code

Clone the repo locally and open the main.R script to follow the instructions from there.
